This framework offers a novel approach to parameter practical identifiability, regularization, and uncertainty quantification.
This fold includes the codes and data for applications of our framework to Hill functions, neural networks, and dynamic biological models demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed computational framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.
Our framework is presented as follows:
